# JotaNotes
Simple, multiplatform, multi-languaje notepad with custom filetype support.

The Web-based edition works the best with .jne files.
The Python edition works the best with regular files.
The C++ edition, well, I don't know if it works since I can't compile it (yet).

I still have to bring some files from there to here.
